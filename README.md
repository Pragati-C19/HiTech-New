# Hi-Tech Controls Website

I have done modifications to the Hi-Tech Control company's old website. This company provides electronic products like solar systems, inverters, etc. This website allows users to search for electronic products to buy and to get information about those products at home. 

## Description : 


In the Hi-Tech Control website, I have used HTML CSS Bootstrap for designing purposes and JS for backend working.  Now, this website is more user-friendly and helps users to save time with lots of information. I  have used some animations like slide bar, flapping cards, image hover, etc. I have created the main logo and also other symbols or images using paint.net and Figma apps. In contacting us with contact info and feedback from you can see their address located in google maps.
